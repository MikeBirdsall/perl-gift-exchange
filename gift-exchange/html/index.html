        <h1> Gift Management Utilities Menu</h1>
            The tools from this page are for managing giving gifts for birthdays, surprises, 
            just about anything you want. But I realize they get used for Christmas, mostly. 
            If there is anything you think I should change, let me know by sending me email at 
            <A href="mailto:christmas@kirkbird.com">The Christmas List Administrator</A>

                    Do you want to reserve it so that no one else will duplicate it? 
                    All these and more can be answered or accomplished with this tool.
